# Hi, I'm Idode Destiny 👋

## System Architect / Technical Project Manager

I design AI-enabled systems where **authority is explicit**, **failure is visible**, and **decisions are explainable**.

My work focuses on system architecture for high-risk and administrative platforms, with particular attention to:
- Governance and policy enforcement  
- Human-in-the-loop decision systems  
- AI as advisory (not authoritative)  
- Traceability, auditability, and failure modes  

---

## What I Do

- Design end-to-end system architectures using **C4 (L1–L4)**  
- Define **authority boundaries** between humans, policy, execution, AI, and audit  
- Model **data domains, ownership, and invariants** before implementation  
- Design **decision-centric UIs** that reduce risk rather than hide it  
- Translate complex systems into structures teams can build independently  

I prioritize **clarity over cleverness** and **safety over speed**.

## Featured Work

### 🔐 SentinelOps AI Admin Platform  
*A governed, AI-assisted administrative system*

- AI provides **advisory insight only**
- Humans make explicit decisions
- Policy gates execution deterministically
- Execution is controlled and idempotent
- Every action is fully auditable end-to-end

📌 Hosted under **Aegis Systems Architecture**

👉 See repository for:
- System & container architecture
- Data domains and invariants
- End-to-end traceability walkthrough
- UI architecture and state machines
- Decision-centric UI sketches

## How I Think About Systems

- **No single component should have end-to-end authority**
- **If something fails, the system should explain itself**
- **AI must surface uncertainty, not hide it**
- **UI should be a decision surface, not a control plane**
- **The system must still work when AI is unavailable**

I design systems so the *wrong things are impossible*, not just discouraged.
