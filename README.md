# IDODE DESTINY

**AI Systems Architect | Technical Project Manager**

I design and design AI-enabled systems where authority is explicit, failure is visible, and decisions remain explainable. My work sits at the intersection of AI engineering, system architecture, and governed execution, with focus on designing intelligent platforms that are safe, auditable, and operational in the real world.

I specialize in architecting systems that do not collapse under uncertainty, where AI supports decisions but does not silently control outcomes, and where every action is traceable end to end.

## WHAT I DO

- Architect end-to-end intelligent systems using C4 architecture and domain modeling
- Design agentic and AI-assisted platforms with clear authority boundaries
- design RAG, agentic memory, and knowledge-driven systems for real-world execution
- Model data ownership, invariants, and system failure domains before implementation
- Translate complex architecture into modular structures teams can design independently
- Design decision-centric interfaces that reduce operational and governance risk
- Ensure systems remain functional even when AI components degrade or fail

I prioritize **clarity over cleverness**, **traceability over opacity**, and **controlled execution over automation without accountability**.

## FEATURED ARCHITECTURE WORK

### **SentinelOps Governed AI Platform**

A controlled AI-assisted administrative system designed for high-risk environments.

- AI provides advisory insight only
- Humans make explicit, accountable decisions
- Policy gates execution deterministically
- Execution is controlled and idempotent
- Full auditability and traceability across system lifecycle

**Repository includes:**
- System and container architecture
- Data domains and invariants
- Decision traceability model
- UI state and decision flows
- Governance-driven execution design

## ENGINEERING PROJECTS

**Agentic Memory System**  
Persistent AI memory architecture enabling context continuity and autonomous reasoning.

**Enterprise RAG Platform**  
Semantic search and knowledge retrieval for production AI services.

**Authority Layer Framework**  Authentication and decision gating system for governed AI execution.

**Internal Admin Platform**  
Decision-centric internal tools for high-stakes administration.

## PREFERRED PROBLEM DOMAINS

I work best in environments involving:

- AI platforms and intelligent systems
- Governance and decision-sensitive software
- Internal tools and administrative platforms
- Agentic and RAG-driven systems
- Architecture and technical coordination roles

---

## TECHNOLOGY PREFERENCES

**Primary tools for production AI systems:**

- Languages: TypeScript/Node.js, Python
- Agentic AI: OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, CrewAI
- Data: PostgreSQL, Pinecone, Prisma
- Infrastructure: Docker, Vercel, GitHub Actions
- Frontend: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS

My decisions are driven by safety, auditability, clarity, and operational stability. I choose technologies that do not degrade under scale, deploy predictably, and produce traceable output.

Each tool selection is justified by system context. TypeScript for type-safe full stack development, PostgreSQL for acid-transactional data storage, Anthropic for governed-AI workflows, and Prisma for schema-first data layers that prevent runtime failure.
